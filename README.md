### ISSUES
* don't understand 1st plot
  * so much data (2000+) observations
  * customizing the x-axis ticks (are they really in the right place?)
  * after correcting, make necessary mods to app.py in this route "/api/v1.0/precipitation"
  * change SUM to AVG in grouping to see if graph gets closer to instructions
* correct the "/api/v1.0/stations" route to only return station names
* TODO: "Use Pandas to calcualte the summary statistics for the precipitation data"
* which queries needed the joins?
* ~plot 2 doesn't quite look like the example~
