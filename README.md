### ISSUES
* don't understand 1st plot
  * so much data (2000+) observations
  * customizing the x-axis ticks (are they really in the right place?) (yes, if you convert to date it will look ok)
  * after correcting, make necessary mods to app.py in this route "/api/v1.0/precipitation"
  * ~change SUM to AVG in grouping to see if graph gets closer to instructions~
* correct the "/api/v1.0/stations" route to only return station names (see below and use JOIN)
* TODO: "Use Pandas to calcualte the summary statistics for the precipitation data"
* which queries needed the joins? The one where you output the "stations in the dataset"
* ~plot 2 doesn't quite look like the example~
* "active stations"?  where the hell is this??
* ~the class seems to be using a single station for the app queries???~
* add the "tobs" route in app.py
